##### Default fonts:#########
# If FLTK has been configured with Xft enabled (the default), you can use
# scalable fonts such as DejaVu or Liberation (try running
# "fc-list : family | cut -d ',' -f 2 | sort").
font_serif="DejaVu Serif"
#font_sans_serif="DejaVu Sans"
#font_cursive="URW Chancery L"
#font_fantasy="DejaVu Sans"
#font_monospace="DejaVu Sans Mono"
#
# Otherwise, use bitmapped fonts like the following (for a list, try running
# "xlsfonts -fn *-iso10646-1 | grep -v -e -0-0 | cut -d - -f 3 | sort | uniq").
font_serif="times"
# font_sans_serif="helvetica"
# font_cursive="helvetica"
# font_fantasy="helvetica"
# font_monospace="courier"

## All fontsizes are scaled by this value
# font_factor=1.5
font_factor=1.0
## Maximum font size in pixels
font_max_size=100
## Minimum font size in pixels
font_min_size=12

###Hiefienization########
# Penalties are used to control good and bad break points. The bigger
# the penalty for a given break point, the less likely the line is
# broken here. "inf" means that breaking is prohibited, "-inf" means
# that a line *must* be broken here. (The latter should not be used
# here, however.) Normal spaces get a penalty of 0. The exact
# definition can be found in doc/dw-line-breaking.doc.

# Penalties for hyphenation breaks; this covers automatic hyphenation,
# soft hyphens, and unconditional hyphens. Since hyphenation should
# rather be avoided, the default values are larger than 0.

# This is used for hyphenation points, when there is no hyphen or dash
# before:
penalty_hyphen = 10

# This is used for hyphenation points, when the line before ends
# already with a hyphen or a dash. Consequent lines ending with
# hyphens or dashes should be avoided, so this value is bigger than
# "penalty_hyphen":
penalty_hyphen_2 = 4

# The same for a break right of an em-dash, when there are no spaces
# surrounding it (as in English). The default values are the same as
# for hyphens:
penalty_em_dash_right = 2
penalty_em_dash_right_2 = 2

# Penalty for a break *left* of an em-dash. Since a line ending with
# an em-dash (and so breaking right of the em-dash) looks better than
# a line beginning with an em-dash (breaking left of an em-dash), the
# default value is bigger than "penalty_em_dash_right":
penalty_em_dash_left = 8

# Notice that there is no "penalty_em_dash_left_2", since breaking
# left of an em-dash makes the line *begin*, not *end* with a dash.

# This factor is multiplied with the line height to get the
# stretchability of a non-justified line. The larger this factor (and
# thus, the stretchability), the less likely the words are hyphenated;
# so you can use this value to control hyphenation of non-justified
# text.
stretchability_factor=4

### UI theme
## "none" is the default FLTK appearance, which "resembles old Windows...and
# old GTK/KDE".
## "plastic" "is inspired by the Aqua user interface on Mac OS X".
## "gtk+" "is inspired by the Red Hat Bluecurve theme".

# This can be useful for privacy and for working around servers who think
# Dillo is less capable than it really is. However, if you pretend to use a

# and bugs of that other browser -- or even disallow access in cases like
# wget or googlebot. Remember this before submitting bug reports.
